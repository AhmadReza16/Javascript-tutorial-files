# 📚 JavaScript Practice – Bro Code Series

This repository contains my personal practice files while following the **JavaScript tutorial series** by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez).  
Each folder contains JavaScript code related to specific tutorial videos. I organized and structured the content in parts of 10 lessons for better readability and progress tracking.
